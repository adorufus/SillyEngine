### Game Engine Roadmap

#### 2. Core Engine Development
- Initial steps for setting up the engine's core functionality.
  - Implementing basic rendering pipeline using OpenGL or Vulkan.
  - Creating a scene graph system.
  - Implementing resource management (textures, models, shaders, etc.).
  - Developing a basic input handling system.

#### 3. Graphics and Rendering
- Advancing the rendering capabilities and visuals of the engine.
  - Implementing advanced rendering techniques (PBR, HDR, shadows, etc.).
  - Adding support for different rendering APIs (OpenGL, Vulkan).
  - Integrating support for different shader languages.

#### 4. Physics and Simulation
- Introducing physics and simulation capabilities.
  - Integrating a physics engine (e.g., Bullet, PhysX).
  - Implementing collision detection and response.
  - Integrating rigid body dynamics and constraints.

#### 5. Audio and Sound
- Adding support for audio capabilities.
  - Implementing audio playback.
  - Integrating spatial audio for 3D environments.
  - Supporting various audio formats and codecs.

#### 6. Scripting and Extensibility
- Enabling scripting and extensibility features.
  - Integrating a scripting language (e.g., Lua, Python).
  - Implementing a plugin system for easy extensibility.
  - Allowing users to customize and extend engine functionality.

#### 7. Editor Development
- Creating a user-friendly editor for game development.
  - Building a GUI for scene editing, asset management, and debugging.
  - Implementing tools for level design, particle effects, etc.

#### 8. Optimization and Performance
- Improving engine performance and optimization.
  - Profiling and optimizing critical code paths.
  - Implementing multithreading for parallel processing.
  - Minimizing memory usage and optimizing resource handling.

#### 9. Documentation and Community
- Focusing on creating documentation and engaging the community.
  - Writing comprehensive API documentation.
  - Creating tutorials and examples for ease of use.
  - Building a community around the engine through forums, Discord, etc.

#### 10. Release and Maintenance
- Finalizing the release and ongoing maintenance of the engine.
  - Preparing for the initial public release.
  - Establishing a versioning and release schedule.
  - Planning for ongoing bug fixes, updates, and improvements.
